 * <p>A sentenceConstructor is the object that, in the processing pipeline, takes care of the
 * creation of the SentenceBuilder object starting from the String to translate.
 *
 * <p>From now on, all processing activities will be performed passing through the SentenceBuilder
 * and namely its editors, keeping track of which transformation were applied.
 *
 * <p>Therefore the usage of the SentenceConstructor marks the passage from the series of
 * transformation that we don't have to remember about to the series of transformation that it's
 * necessary to keep track of in our processing pipeline.
 *
 * <p>In the future, the SentenceConstructor will also implement caching techniques.
